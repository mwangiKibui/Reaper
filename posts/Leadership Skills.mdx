### Leadership skills in the society

According to the Oxford Dictionary, leadership is defined as the action of leading a group of
people or an organization.
It is important to establish leadership in every organization and institution regardless of the size
of the group of people involved, as those appointed to this role act as a guide to attaining the
required goals and mission as required.
It is also important to have the leader appointed according to a set of merits that will ensure that
a quality person is chosen to lead others through an activity.
The merits of the leader include confidence, strategic and innovative thinking, integrity, and
maintaining proper communication, among others.
Delegating leadership positions in an institution promotes division of labor while motivating
others to work towards achieving the set goals that the leaders promote. In this, it is possible to
make progress while easily maintaining order within the institution.
With this, I find it much more efficient to promote societal leadership since it leads to a sense of
order among people while strategically improving society.
